# Linear Model on Spending Rate

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Linear Model on Spending Rate" repository. This project focuses on developing a linear regression model in Python to predict an individual's spending rate based on their gender, age, and annual income. Understanding how these factors influence consumer spending patterns is useful for businesses and marketers.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is available from [AbsentData](https://absentdata.com/data-analysis/where-to-find-data/). It includes anonymized customer information, such as gender, age, annual income, and their corresponding spending rates. This dataset serves as the foundation for our predictive modeling.

## Objective

The model try to make a linear regression approach to establish relationships between the selected features and spending behavior.
